Pick low-hanging fruit
======================

Merely enabling Real-time Ubuntu doesn't optimise the kernel for your
application. Tuning may be helpful, for example to reduce cycle-times and other
latencies. Real-time Ubuntu offers various configuration options and boot
parameters for the purpose.

Treat tuning techniques as a toolkit, to choose from according to the demands
of your application and the environment it runs in. At each step, apply the
most important and readily available improvement. An early candidate is the
kernel's task scheduler.
