# Conclusion

In this tutorial, three easy-to-use features of the Intel TCC toolbox, along with some kernel command line parameters, were introduced to optimize real-time performance. These features and techniques help system integrators quickly tune the system for specific real-time use cases:
- TCC Mode: Optimizes firmware for low latency with a single configuration knob.
- Cache Allocation Technology (CAT): Enables quick partitioning of the cache to improve temporal isolation.
- Speed Shift for Edge Computing: Can be used to boost single-threaded performance.

By leveraging these tools, system integrators can efficiently enhance the performance and reliability of their real-time applications.
