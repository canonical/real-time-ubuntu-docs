# Several fields use the CPU Lists format. 
# For the CPU Lists spec, refer to
# https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html#cpu-lists

# Kernel command line parameters
kernel_cmdline:
  # Isolate CPUs from general execution
  # Format: CPU Lists
  # isolcpus: "2-3"

  # Enable/disable dynamic ticks during idle time
  # Supported values: on | off
  # nohz: "on"

  # Enable/disable full dynamic ticks
  # Format: CPU Lists
  # nohz_full: "2-3"

  # Allocated CPUs for kernel threads
  # Format: CPU Lists
  # kthread_cpus: "0-1"

  # Allocate CPUs for IRQ handling
  # Format: CPU Lists
  # irqaffinity: "0-1"

# Runtime options for IRQ affinity
irq_tuning:
  # - # CPUs to which the IRQs are to be moved
  #   # Format: range, e.g. 0-2
  #   cpus: "2-3"
  #   # Arguments used to filter IRQs
  #   filter:
  #     actions: "iwlwifi"
  #     chip_name: "IR-PCI"
  #     name: "edge"
  #     type: "edge"

# Runtime options for CPU frequency scaling
cpu_governance: 
  # - # CPUs to which the scaling_governor options are to be applied
  #   # Format: CPU Lists
  #   cpus: "0-1"
  #   scaling_governor: "performance"
  #   min_frequency: "1.2GHz"
  #   max_frequency: "2.5GHz"
