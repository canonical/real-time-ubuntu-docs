# Isolate workload using CPUsets

[CPUsets][kdocs_cset] is a kernel feature that allow users to assign specific CPUs and memory nodes to a set of tasks, enabling fine-grained control over resource allocation.
Previously, users could configure CPUsets by directly manipulating the cpuset pseudo-filesystem or using the Python-based utility [cset][cset_manpage].
However, the cset tool is only compatible with legacy systems running cgroup v1.
With the introduction of cgroup v2â€”adopted by Ubuntu 21.10 (Impish Indri) and latter versions, also by most other distributions around 2021, CPUset management is now handled within the unified cgroup v2 hierarchy.
As a result, configuring CPUsets requires interacting with cgroup v2 instead of relying on cset.
