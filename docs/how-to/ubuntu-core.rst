Real-time Ubuntu Core
=====================  

Different from classic versions of Ubuntu (Desktop and Server), `Ubuntu Core`_ is a minimal, secure and strictly confined operating system designed to run on embedded devices.
Ubuntu Core is a snap-based operating system, meaning it uses snap packages to manage applications and services.
Its read-only nature makes it a very secure and reliable operating system but also makes it different to configure.

This collection of documents focuses on configuring Ubuntu Core for real-time computing.
