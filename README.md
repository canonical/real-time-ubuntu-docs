# Real-time Ubuntu

Real-time Ubuntu ensures high-priority processes are executed first, with
deterministic response times.

## Project and community

The Real-time Ubuntu documentation project welcomes community contributions, suggestions,
fixes and constructive feedback. If you wish to contribute to Real-time Ubuntu,
please follow [the guide][contribute].

Before raising a pull request, it's generally worth [opening an
issue][open-issue] to discuss any proposed change unless it's trivial. Then, if
you decide to raise a pull request, be sure you've signed the [Canonical
contributor agreement][contributor-agreement] â€” it's the easiest way to grant
us permission to use your contributions.
